The distance between the Earth and the Moon and the Earth and the Sun varies. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Earth to Moon:**
    *   Average distance: **384,400 kilometers (238,900 miles)**
    *   The Moon's orbit is elliptical, so the distance ranges from roughly 363,104 km (225,623 miles) at perigee (closest point) to 405,696 km (252,088 miles) at apogee (farthest point).

*   **Earth to Sun:**
    *   Average distance: **149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles)**. This distance is also defined as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU).
    *   The Earth's orbit is also elliptical, ranging from roughly 147.1 million km (91.4 million miles) at perihelion (closest point, around January 3rd) to 152.1 million km (94.5 million miles) at aphelion (farthest point, around July 4th).

**Important Note:** These are distances from the *Earth* to the Moon and Sun. The question asked "distance of moon and sun". If you want the distance *between* the Moon and the Sun, that will vary greatly depending on their positions relative to Earth. Sometimes the Moon will be between the Earth and Sun (new moon), and sometimes the Earth will be. The range would be roughly:

*   Minimum: 149.6 million km - 0.406 million km = ~ 149.2 million km
*   Maximum: 149.6 million km + 0.406 million km = ~ 150.0 million km

(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \Big[\, y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))\Big] \] :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} --- ## ✅ What This Means (in plain speak) - **Hypothesis**: Logistic regression predicts a *probability* of the positive class (0–1), not a continuous value. - **Loss / Cost**: The cost function penalizes wrong predictions — especially when the model is “confident but wrong.” The penalty grows steeply for confident mispredictions (probability near 0 or 1 but wrong label), which forces the model during training to adjust parameters so that its predicted probabilities align better with actual labels. --- If you want — I can also give you the **gradient descent update rules** (or the derivative of this loss) for logistic regression. That completes the whole training picture. ::contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
